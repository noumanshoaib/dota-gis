# Game State Integration
The purpose of this project is to establish communication between the frontend, backend, and Game State Integration (GSI) for the Dota 2 game. This will enable the real-time display of the drafting process in Captains Mode. The system aims to:

1. **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Develop a user interface that interacts with the backend server to provide real-time updates.

2. **Backend-GSI Integration**: Implement backend (**Fastify** a web framework of **NodeJs**) service that interface with Dota 2's GSI, ensuring timely data retrieval from the game.

3. **Real-Time Drafting Display**: Create a dynamic frontend (**React**) component to visualize the drafting phase of Captains Mode, reflecting the picks and bans as they occur in real-time.

## Assumptions
1. There will be one client communicating with the backend, so the backend does not support multiple clients communication.
2. As different unique auth tokens can also be used to define multiple different clients for identification (as I read in one of the shared resources in the assessment), in my case, I am just considering one client, also I am validating requests coming to the server if they match the auth token from the client. Just to show a good practise to allow only valid clients. (it can be unnecessary depending on different scenarios)
## Notes
1. The frontend displays both Dire and Radiant bonus times, as well as the active time for each pick and ban. At the end of the draft, it shows the player names below each picked hero card, indicating who picked that hero.
2. The project only works with the drafting of captains mode in dota 2.
3. Real-time communication can be achieved using various methods such as WebSockets, Server-Side Events, Long Polling etc. In this case, WebSockets (socket.io) are used.
4. I have seen multiple implementation of **GSI** using events (event driven) which is more modular and scalable approach, where we emit data when we receive it from the game client which enable us to subscribe to certain data attributes coming from **GSI** based on our needs, I like the approach as well, as it makes the code more modular, scalable, maintainable and reusable, and we can write business logic based on specific attributes changes in clean manner, but I just implement a simplified approach to complete the task, by assuming it a small and simple application for the assessment, I am passing everything as it is coming from the game client after transforming the response into a better data structure, so it is simpler for the frontend to understand.

The repository contains two folders:
1. backend
2. frontend

## Setting up the projects


### Running using docker

The project has been shipped with docker-compose.yml file, which can run the both services backend and frontend in one command.

To set up the both projects

```
docker-compose up
```

The backend will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and frontend will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:3001](http://127.0.0.1:3001)

You can skip to the final step - **Enabling Game State Integration (GSI) for Dota 2**

### Running the backend (Manually)

### Step 1

Go to the project directory inside **backend** folder and run the following command.

```
//installing the node modules
npm i
```
### Step 2

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, it contains the below environment variables

```
AUTH_TOKEN=NoumanTest
PORT=3000
```

The **AUTH_TOKEN** should match with the **AUTH TOKEN** of game state integration configuration file

The backend is verifying the `AUTH.TOKEN` coming from the game stats object 
that is getting **POST** to our backend service
to ensure if the request coming from a valid client.

### Step 3

To run the project run the below command
```
npm start
```

you can access the server at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

### Running the Frontend

### Step 1
Go to the project directory **frontend** folder and run the following command to install node modules.
```
npm i
```

### Step 2

Rename the .env.example to .env and the below variables

```
REACT_APP_SOCKET_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000"
PORT=3001
```

As the **backend** is running on port `3000`, the frontend is set to run on port `3001` to avoid port conflicts. You can run it on any port as required.

The **REACT_APP_SOCKET_SERVER_URL** should be the socket.io server URL, which is the URL of our backend. So, if the backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, this should be the URL we have to put here.

## Final Step - Enabling Game State Integration (GSI) for Dota 2

Enabling GSI is a two-step process. First, instruct the game client to enable GSI by following these steps:

1. Open Steam and navigate to your `library`.
2. Right-click on `Dota 2` and select `Properties`.
3. Click on the `General` tab.
4. In the `Launch Options` field, enter `-gamestateintegration`.

Next, you need to create a configuration file that the game client can parse. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Navigate to your Dota 2 directory for example: `YOUR_STEAM_DIRECTORY\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\gamestate_integration\.`
2. Create a file with a name starting with `gamestate_integration_` and ending with `.cfg`. For example, `gamestate_integration_my_service.cfg` and place the below content into it to receive the data for drafting.

```
"dota2-gsi Configuration"
{
    "uri"               "http://127.0.0.1:3000/dota2-gsi"
    "timeout"           "5.0"
    "buffer"            "0.0"
    "throttle"          "0.1"
    "heartbeat"         "30.0"
    "data"
    {
        "buildings"     "0"
        "provider"      "0"
        "map"           "0"
        "player"        "1"
        "hero"          "1"
        "abilities"     "0"
        "items"         "0"
        "draft"         "1"
        "wearables"     "0"
    }
    "auth"
    {
        "token"         "NoumanTest"
    }
}

```

In the above configuration, I have enabled only draft, player, and hero to show picks, bans, and the timer. For picks and bans, enabling only draft was enough. However, to display which hero was picked by each player, I also enabled hero and player data.

I have kept buffer to `0.0` as I am running it on localhost, but can be tuned according to the requirement and setup.

**Note: `http://127.0.0.1:3000` is the base url of your backend and `/dota2-gsi` is the route url where backend is expecting to receive the game stats** 

Now run the game, start watching a tournament in captains mode, or download an old tournament match and watch the replay. Check the frontend application for draft updates. ðŸ˜Š
